of any of the other covenants or conditions hereof, Lessor may give Tenant notice of such default and if Tenant does not cure any 
such default within _________________ (this shall be fifteen, if no other number is filled in) days, after the giving of such notice 
(or if such other default is of such nature that it cannot be completely cured within such period, if Tenant does not commence such 
curing within such ___________(this shall be fifteen, if no other number is filled in) days and thereafter proceed with reasonable 
diligence and good faith to cure such default), then Lessor may terminate this Lease and all rights of Lessee under this Lease by such 
written notice. If it so terminates on the date specified in such notice the term of this Lease shall terminate, and Tenant shall then 
quit and surrender the Real Property to Lessor, but Tenant shall remain liable as hereinafter provided. If this Lease shall have been 
so terminated by Lessor, Lessor may at any time thereafter resume possession of the Real Property by any lawful means and remove 
Tenant or other occupants and their effects. No failure to enforce any term shall be deemed a waiver. 
No act of Lessor shall be construed as terminating this Lease except written notice given by Lessor to Tenant advising Tenant that 
Lessor elects to terminate the Lease. In the event Lessor elects to terminate this Lease, Lessor may recover from Tenant: (a) The 
worth at the time of award of any unpaid rent that had been earned at the time of termination of the Lease; (b) The worth at the time 
of award of the amount by which the unpaid rent that would have been earned after termination of the Lease until the time of award 
exceeds the amount of rental loss that Tenant proves could have been reasonably avoided; (c) The worth at the time of award of the 
amount by which the unpaid rent for the balance of the term of this lease after the time of award exceeds the amount of rental loss 
that Tenant proves could be reasonably avoided; and (d) Any other amount necessary to compensate Lessor for all detrimental 
proximately caused by Tenant’s failure to perform its obligations under this Lease. 
The term "rent” as used in this Lease shall mean Rent and all other sums required to be paid by Tenant pursuant to the terms of this 
Lease 
17. Security Deposit. Tenant shall deposit with Lessor on the signing of this Lease the sum of 
______________________________ Dollars ($ ) as security for the performance of Tenant’s obligations under this 
Lease, including without limitation the surrender of possession of the Real Property to Lessor as herein provided. If Lessor applies 
any part of the deposit to cure any default of Tenant, Tenant shall on demand deposit with Lessor the amount so applied so that 
Lessor shall have the full deposit on hand at all times during the term of this Lease. 
18. Tax Increase. In the event there is any increase during any year of the term of this Lease in real property taxes over and above 
the amount of such taxes assessed for the tax year during which the term of this Lease commences, whether because of increased 
rate, valuation or otherwise, Tenant shall pay to Lessor upon presentation of paid tax bills an amount equal to the increase in taxes 
upon the land and building on which the Real Property is situated. In the event that such taxes are assessed for a tax year extending 
beyond the term of the Lease, the obligation of Tenant shall be proportionate to the portion of the Lease term included in such year. 
All such tax obligations of Lessee hereunder shall be added to and become a part of the rent paid under this Lease. 
19. Common Area Expenses. In the event the Real Property is situated in a shopping center, a commercial building or other 
complex in which there are common areas, Tenant agrees to pay Tenant’s pro-rata share of maintenance, taxes, and insurance for 
the common area. All such obligations of Tenant hereafter shall be added to and become a part of the rent paid under this Lease. 
20. Attorney’s Fees. In case suit should be brought for recovery of the Real Property, or for any sum due hereunder, or because of 
any act which may arise out of the possession of the Real Property, by either party, the prevailing party shall be entitled to all costs 
incurred in connection with such action, including a reasonable attorney’s fee. 
21. Waiver. No failure of Lessor to enforce any term hereof shall be deemed to be a waiver. 
22. Notices. Any notice which either party may or is required to give, shall be given by personal delivery or mailing the same, 
postage prepaid, to Tenant at the Real Property (or at the address indicated below), or Lessor at the address specified below, or at 
such other places as may be designated by the parties from time to time.

of the parties. 
24. Subordination. This Lease is and shall be subordinated to all existing and future liens, mortgages, deeds of trust, ground 
leases, hypothecations, security devices and encumbrances (“Security Instruments”) against the Real Property now or hereafter 
placed upon the Real Property, to any and all advances made under any of said Security Instruments. Tenant covenants and agrees 
to execute and deliver, upon demand, those instruments reasonably necessary to effect such subordination. Self-executing: The

coupled with an interest and is irrevocable. Provided, that upon written request from a Lender or Lessor in connection with a sale, 
financing or refinancing of the Premises, Lessee and Lessor shall execute such further writings as may be reasonably required to
